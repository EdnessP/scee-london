SCEE London Studios PACKAGE extractor
          Written by Edness          


This is a tool that extracts London Studio PACKAGE files (.PKF, .PKD, .THEMES)
used in various PS3 titles of theirs (SingStar, DanceStar, EyePet, etc.)
It supports all of its variants - plain, compressed, encrypted, 32/64-bit.

Some games may have an additional layer of SDAT/EDAT or disc sector encryption;
this is not handled by my tool.  You must decrypt those beforehand with other
already existing tools.


== Usage (Simple, Windows only) ==
Drag and drop the PACKAGE file onto the .EXE file.


== Usage (Proper, Windows/Linux) ==
Provide a path to a PACKAGE file, and optionally also a path to a chosen output
directory through a terminal or command line interface.


== Support ==
While completely optional, you can support me here if you wish:
