SCEE London Studio PACKAGE extractor
           Made by Edness           


This is a tool that extracts London Studio PACKAGE files (.PKF, .PKD, .THEMES)
used in a multitude of PS3 releases:
  SingStar, DanceStar Party (Everybody Dance), EyePet (Me & My Pet),
  TV Superstars, Me Motion, Aqua Vita (Aquatopia), Mesmerize,
  Operation Creature Feature, The Trials of Topoq, Tori-Emaki.
It supports all of its variants - plain, compressed, encrypted, 32/64-bit.

Some games may have an additional layer of SDAT/EDAT or disc sector encryption;
that is not handled by this tool.  You must decrypt those beforehand with other
already existing tools.


== Usage (Simple, Windows only) ==
Drag and drop the PACKAGE file onto the .EXE file.


== Usage (Proper, Windows/Linux) ==
Provide a path to a PACKAGE file, and optionally also a path to a chosen output
directory through a terminal or command line interface.


== Shout-Outs ==
Special shout-out to the friends, good folk and the community behind Redump.org
